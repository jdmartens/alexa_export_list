# alexa_export_list
This was intended to be an Alexa skill that exported Alexa lists to CSV via email. However, I recently discovered that the API for working with lists is no longer supported.

As of July 1, 2024, List skills and the List Management REST API to access Alexa lists, such as the Alexa Shopping and To-Do lists, in your skills or apps are no longer supported.

For more information, see the [deprecated features documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-overviews/deprecated-features.html#shopping-lists).

So I'm not going to work on this anymore.
